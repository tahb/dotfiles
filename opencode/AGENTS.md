# My Preferences

## Approach

- Minimise token spend on every request
- Read existing files before writing. Don't re-read unless changed.
- Thorough in reasoning, concise in output.
- Skip files over 100KB unless required.
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- No emojis or em-dashes.
- Do not guess APIs, versions, flags, commit SHAs, or package names. Verify by reading code or docs before asserting.
- Check memory to prevent re-investigating solved problems

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes,
simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

## Language

- British English
- Caveman ultra mode on by default
- cut filler, maximise conciseness
- no emojis, no em-dashes
- pattern: "[thing] [action] [reason]". [next step]

## Tools

- MacOS
- VScode

## Planning

- plans to ./tmp/
- prefer mermaid diagrams

## Coding

- TDD: red, green, refactor
- small steps
- simple, readable code
- principle of simplicity (YAGNI)
- prefer existing standards + conventions from the codebase
- convention over config
- minimise comments except when necessary
- avoid over-engineering
- suggest refactoring first when it could make the change easier
- // TODO: for todos

## Git

- default no git writes
- atomic commits when asked
- descriptive messages with [1] citations
- no co-authors unless asked

## Testing

- all code must have 100% test coverage
- start with integration/e2e tests
- write edge cases and error paths
- all tests, linters and formatters must pass, check Makefiles
- mock external deps
- `gg` alias for billing-streams

## Code Review

- use superpowers plugin

## Permissions

- read-only commands (including `rtk*`) without confirmation
- confirm mutating or destructive commands, including with `rtk` prefix eg `rtl touch` and `rtk curl`
